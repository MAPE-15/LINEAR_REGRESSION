# LINEAR_REGRESSION  

### NOTES  
Included 3 models.  

One called simple linear regression uses no sklearn and is made from scratch.  
Takes only one feature that's why is called simple.  

Other is called multiple linear regression, uses no sklearn and also is made from scratch.  
But here it takes as many features you want, the number of features doesn't matter.  

The last Linear Regression Best Model, uses sklearn, so it's faster and more reliable.  
If want to make serious prediction this one is recommended.  
Also outputs ANOVA table, Coefficients table and Model Summary table.  
Plus you can choose to run the model more than one time, to really take the best results of the model, and in addition you can load a model or save one.
